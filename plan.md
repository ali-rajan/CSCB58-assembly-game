# Project Plan

## General Idea

- Auto-scrolling platforms
  - Random heights, cannot be too high for jumping to work at highest point
  - Same length for all platforms
  - Collision detection between player and platforms
- Square players and enemies
  - Different colours for each type of entity
  - Collision between player and enemy to lose HP
- Enemies are obstacles moving horizontally towards player
  - Shooting lasers
- Hearts to count HP
- Gravity and jumping along with horizontal movement
- Fail condition: player falls too low or all `total_hp` HP lost to enemy collisions
- Win condition: `evasion_target` enemies evaded
- Restart or quit at any point with certain key presses
